# VisionX-Pro-AI-Powered-Medical-Image-Restoration-Diagnostic-Assistant
VisionX Pro is an end-to-end medical imaging system that leverages state-of-the-art deep learning (SwinIR) and multimodal AI (Google Gemini) to restore degraded X-ray images and generate clinically relevant diagnostic insights—simulating a full radiology workflow within a single notebook. 🩺 VisionX Pro: AI-Powered Medical Image Restoration & Diagnostic Assistant VisionX Pro is an end-to-end medical imaging system that leverages state-of-the-art deep learning (SwinIR) and multimodal AI (Google Gemini) to restore degraded X-ray images and generate clinically relevant diagnostic insights—simulating a full radiology workflow within a single notebook.

🔍 Overview This project demonstrates how modern vision transformers can enhance low-quality medical scans (e.g., due to noise, blur, motion artifacts, or low contrast) and how large multimodal models can interpret restored images to produce:

Radiologist-style diagnostic reports Patient-friendly clinical summaries Actionable treatment recommendations Professional visualization dashboards Designed for research, education, and prototyping in AI-assisted radiology.

🧠 Core Features Image Restoration: Uses SwinIR (Swin Transformer for Image Restoration) to enhance degraded X-rays. Clinical Degradation Simulation: Applies realistic artifacts (noise, blur, motion blur, low contrast) to test robustness. AI Radiology Analysis: Integrates Google Gemini 1.5 Flash for vision-based interpretation of restored images. Automated Reporting: Generates: Technical restoration reports Detailed radiology findings Patient-focused clinical notes Treatment & referral recommendations Visual Dashboard: Summarizes system performance, clinical impact, and sample results in a single figure. 🛠️ Technologies Used Deep Learning: SwinIR, PyTorch, basicsr AI Models: google-generativeai (Gemini 1.5 Flash) Image Processing: OpenCV, Pillow, scipy, albumentations Environment: Google Colab–compatible setup with full dependency management 📁 Output Files Restored medical images (direct_results/) medical_image_restoration_report.txt medical_diagnosis_analysis.txt patient_clinical_assessment.txt treatment_recommendations.txt Summary dashboard (visual) ⚠️ Disclaimer This tool is for educational and research purposes only. It does not replace professional medical diagnosis. Always consult a qualified radiologist or physician for clinical decisions.

✅ Quick Start Upload an X-ray image (or use synthetic test data) Run the notebook in Google Colab Review AI-generated diagnostic insights and reports Note: Requires a Google AI API key stored in Colab secrets as GOOGLE_API_KEY.
